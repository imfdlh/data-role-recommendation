,About the Team
,Our GoFinance Data Science team is a group of eight Data Scientists based in Singapore and Indonesia. We build models to predict adoption, churn, credit scores, and pricing on loan applications for our users. We oversee all data aspects of our financial services at Gojek, working to support business expansion across various sectors, and most importantly, to bring wider financial inclusion to as many people in the region as possible.,
One of the biggest obstacles our team has had to overcome was modeling the creditworthiness of thin file users. After many weeks of research, collaboration, and trial and error, we figured out that the best way to tackle this issue was to utilize alternative data, such as in-app behavior and geolocation data. Currently, our team has been busy working on the expansion to e-commerce users, enriching our product family and user base.,
While our team is based all over the region, we’re a tight-knit group who are bonded by two things: the digital transform to help the unbanked, and alignment with personal development in technologies. Our weekly conversations range from market campaign optimizations to state-of-the-art engineering stacks. Off hours, you’d probably find us having fun in board-games. Working from home has been a strange time for a lot of us, so our team has been taking time on our calls to trade advice on the best ways to keep sane with this new work set up. We’re made up of game enthusiasts, sports lovers, and comic fanatics. Once COVID subsides, we’re excited to get together for our weekly dinner and drinks again!",Junior Data Scientist-Financial Services Platform,Jakarta
